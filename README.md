Assignment in my course Object Oriented Programming due january 11th.

Short description of php files:

create.php - creates human player, 2 bots, array of bots-info, array of current-standings-data

challenge.php - executes challenge alone and together

challenge_pick.php - creates challenges, handles REQUEST:challenge alone and REQUEST challengeChange

item.php - creates 10 items, REQUEST human plusItem

reset.php - only handles the click function in base.js of the player starting over from scratch.

Left to do on spare time: 
- The human player's possibility of loosing an item when not winning a challenge. 
- Put the functions "winTool", "looseTool", "acceptChallenge", "changeChallenge", "carryOutChallenge" and "carryOutChallengeWithCompanion".  onto the right classes and run them on each instance of that class. 
- When choosing an enemy to team up with, create "pop-up" where you see enemies stats and after that select companion.
