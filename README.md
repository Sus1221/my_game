my_game
=======
Short description of php files:

create.php - creates human player, 2 bots, array of bots-info, array of current-standings-data

challenge.php - executes challenge alone and together

challenge_pick.php - creates challenges, handles REQUEST:challenge alone and REQUEST challengeChange

item.php - creates 10 items, REQUEST human plusItem

reset.php - only handles the click function in base.js of the player starting over from scratch.

Please observe: one function is missing in this game compared to the grade requirements: the human player's possibility of loosing an item when not winning a challenge. The time ran out on me, and I prioritized delivering a functioning game over all.
